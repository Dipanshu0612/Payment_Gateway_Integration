# Payment Gateway Integration Project.
## The Sparks Foundation
This was a task provided to me as a Web Development Intern.
### About the Project
This is a simple website that has information about The Sparks Foundation and a Donation Button on the navabr and the Home and About pages. <br>
This is build using React JS, Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap.<br>
My task was to integrate the Donation button to get successful payments.
### More Details
This project has been deployed on Netlify. <br> 
For demo:- https://payment-gateway-dipanshu.netlify.app/ <br>
### Important!
This is a responsive website. You can run it and view it on any device.<br>
#### Razorpay Donation Button
The donation button on this website is by Razopay. It is a button which is used in Test Mode. <br>
You can do payments by UPI Id, Cards, Netbanking, Wallets and Pay Later Options. <br>
You can also scan the QR generated by any UPI App. (Doesn't work as it is Test Mode) <br>
NO REAL transaction takes place as it is just for test purposes.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
